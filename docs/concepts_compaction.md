Context Window & Compaction

Every model has a **context window** (max tokens it can see). Long-running chats accumulate messages and tool results; once the window is tight, OpenClaw **compacts** older history to stay within limits.

## [​
](#what-compaction-is)
What compaction is

Compaction **summarizes older conversation** into a compact summary entry and keeps recent messages intact. The summary is stored in the session history, so future requests use:

- The compaction summary

- Recent messages after the compaction point

Compaction **persists** in the session’s JSONL history.

## [​

Configuration

Use the `agents.defaults.compaction` setting in your `openclaw.json` to configure compaction behavior (mode, target tokens, etc.).
Compaction summarization preserves opaque identifiers by default (`identifierPolicy: "strict"`). You can override this with `identifierPolicy: "off"` or provide custom text with `identifierPolicy: "custom"` and `identifierInstructions`.
You can optionally specify a different model for compaction summarization via `agents.defaults.compaction.model`. This is useful when your primary model is a local or small model and you want compaction summaries produced by a more capable model. The override accepts any `provider/model-id` string:
Copy

```
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "compaction": {
        "model": "openrouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5"
      }
    }
  }
}

```

This also works with local models, for example a second Ollama model dedicated to summarization or a fine-tuned compaction specialist:
Copy

```
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "compaction": {
        "model": "ollama/llama3.1:8b"
      }
    }
  }
}

```

When unset, compaction uses the agent’s primary model.

## [​
](#auto-compaction-default-on)
Auto-compaction (default on)

When a session nears or exceeds the model’s context window, OpenClaw triggers auto-compaction and may retry the original request using the compacted context.
You’ll see:

- `🧹 Auto-compaction complete` in verbose mode

- `/status` showing `🧹 Compactions: <count>`

Before compaction, OpenClaw can run a **silent memory flush** turn to store
durable notes to disk. See [Memory](/concepts/memory) for details and config.

## [​
](#manual-compaction)
Manual compaction

Use `/compact` (optionally with instructions) to force a compaction pass:
Copy

```
/compact Focus on decisions and open questions

```

## [​
](#context-window-source)
Context window source

Context window is model-specific. OpenClaw uses the model definition from the configured provider catalog to determine limits.

## [​
](#compaction-vs-pruning)
Compaction vs pruning

- **Compaction**: summarises and **persists** in JSONL.

- **Session pruning**: trims old **tool results** only, **in-memory**, per request.

See [/concepts/session-pruning](/concepts/session-pruning) for pruning details.

## [​
](#openai-server-side-compaction)
OpenAI server-side compaction

OpenClaw also supports OpenAI Responses server-side compaction hints for
compatible direct OpenAI models. This is separate from local OpenClaw
compaction and can run alongside it.

- Local compaction: OpenClaw summarizes and persists into session JSONL.

- Server-side compaction: OpenAI compacts context on the provider side when
`store` + `context_management` are enabled.

See [OpenAI provider](/providers/openai) for model params and overrides.

## [​
](#tips)
Tips

- Use `/compact` when sessions feel stale or context is bloated.

- Large tool outputs are already truncated; pruning can further reduce tool-result buildup.

- If you need a fresh slate, `/new` or `/reset` starts a new session id.
