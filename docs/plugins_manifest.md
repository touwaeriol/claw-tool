# Plugin Manifest

# [​
](#plugin-manifest-openclaw-plugin-json)
Plugin manifest (openclaw.plugin.json)

Every plugin **must** ship a `openclaw.plugin.json` file in the **plugin root**.
OpenClaw uses this manifest to validate configuration without executing plugin
code. Missing or invalid manifests are treated as plugin errors and block
config validation.
See the full plugin system guide: [Plugins](/tools/plugin).

## [​

Required fields

Copy

```
{
  "id": "voice-call",
  "configSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "properties": {}
  }
}

```

Required keys:

- `id` (string): canonical plugin id.

- `configSchema` (object): JSON Schema for plugin config (inline).

Optional keys:

- `kind` (string): plugin kind (examples: `"memory"`, `"context-engine"`).

- `channels` (array): channel ids registered by this plugin (example: `["matrix"]`).

- `providers` (array): provider ids registered by this plugin.

- `skills` (array): skill directories to load (relative to the plugin root).

- `name` (string): display name for the plugin.

- `description` (string): short plugin summary.

- `uiHints` (object): config field labels/placeholders/sensitive flags for UI rendering.

- `version` (string): plugin version (informational).

## [​
](#json-schema-requirements)
JSON Schema requirements

- **Every plugin must ship a JSON Schema**, even if it accepts no config.

- An empty schema is acceptable (for example, `{ "type": "object", "additionalProperties": false }`).

- Schemas are validated at config read/write time, not at runtime.

## [​
](#validation-behavior)
Validation behavior

- Unknown `channels.*` keys are **errors**, unless the channel id is declared by
a plugin manifest.

- `plugins.entries.<id>`, `plugins.allow`, `plugins.deny`, and `plugins.slots.*`
must reference **discoverable** plugin ids. Unknown ids are **errors**.

- If a plugin is installed but has a broken or missing manifest or schema,
validation fails and Doctor reports the plugin error.

- If plugin config exists but the plugin is **disabled**, the config is kept and
a **warning** is surfaced in Doctor + logs.

## [​
](#notes)
Notes

- The manifest is **required for all plugins**, including local filesystem loads.

- Runtime still loads the plugin module separately; the manifest is only for
discovery + validation.

- Exclusive plugin kinds are selected through `plugins.slots.*`.

`kind: "memory"` is selected by `plugins.slots.memory`.

- `kind: "context-engine"` is selected by `plugins.slots.contextEngine`
(default: built-in `legacy`).

- If your plugin depends on native modules, document the build steps and any
package-manager allowlist requirements (for example, pnpm `allow-build-scripts`

`pnpm rebuild <package>`).
