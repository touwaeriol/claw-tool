RPC adapters

OpenClaw integrates external CLIs via JSON-RPC. Two patterns are used today.

## [​
](#pattern-a-http-daemon-signal-cli)
Pattern A: HTTP daemon (signal-cli)

- `signal-cli` runs as a daemon with JSON-RPC over HTTP.

- Event stream is SSE (`/api/v1/events`).

- Health probe: `/api/v1/check`.

- OpenClaw owns lifecycle when `channels.signal.autoStart=true`.

See [Signal](/channels/signal) for setup and endpoints.

## [​
](#pattern-b-stdio-child-process-legacy-imsg)
Pattern B: stdio child process (legacy: imsg)

**Note:** For new iMessage setups, use [BlueBubbles](/channels/bluebubbles) instead.

- OpenClaw spawns `imsg rpc` as a child process (legacy iMessage integration).

- JSON-RPC is line-delimited over stdin/stdout (one JSON object per line).

- No TCP port, no daemon required.

Core methods used:

- `watch.subscribe` → notifications (`method: "message"`)

- `watch.unsubscribe`

- `send`

- `chats.list` (probe/diagnostics)

See [iMessage](/channels/imessage) for legacy setup and addressing (`chat_id` preferred).

## [​
](#adapter-guidelines)
Adapter guidelines

- Gateway owns the process (start/stop tied to provider lifecycle).

- Keep RPC clients resilient: timeouts, restart on exit.

- Prefer stable IDs (e.g., `chat_id`) over display strings.
