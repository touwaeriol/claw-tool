`openclaw daemon`

Legacy alias for Gateway service management commands.
`openclaw daemon ...` maps to the same service control surface as `openclaw gateway ...` service commands.

## [​
](#usage)
Usage

Copy

```
openclaw daemon status
openclaw daemon install
openclaw daemon start
openclaw daemon stop
openclaw daemon restart
openclaw daemon uninstall

```

## [​
](#subcommands)
Subcommands

- `status`: show service install state and probe Gateway health

- `install`: install service (`launchd`/`systemd`/`schtasks`)

- `uninstall`: remove service

- `start`: start service

- `stop`: stop service

- `restart`: restart service

## [​
](#common-options)
Common options

- `status`: `--url`, `--token`, `--password`, `--timeout`, `--no-probe`, `--deep`, `--json`

- `install`: `--port`, `--runtime <node|bun>`, `--token`, `--force`, `--json`

- lifecycle (`uninstall|start|stop|restart`): `--json`

Notes:

- `status` resolves configured auth SecretRefs for probe auth when possible.

- On Linux systemd installs, `status` token-drift checks include both `Environment=` and `EnvironmentFile=` unit sources.

- When token auth requires a token and `gateway.auth.token` is SecretRef-managed, `install` validates that the SecretRef is resolvable but does not persist the resolved token into service environment metadata.

- If token auth requires a token and the configured token SecretRef is unresolved, install fails closed.

- If both `gateway.auth.token` and `gateway.auth.password` are configured and `gateway.auth.mode` is unset, install is blocked until mode is set explicitly.
