Development channels

Last updated: 2026-01-21
OpenClaw ships three update channels:

- **stable**: npm dist-tag `latest`.

- **beta**: npm dist-tag `beta` (builds under test).

- **dev**: moving head of `main` (git). npm dist-tag: `dev` (when published).

We ship builds to **beta**, test them, then **promote a vetted build to `latest`**
without changing the version number — dist-tags are the source of truth for npm installs.

Switching channels

Git checkout:
Copy

```
openclaw update --channel stable
openclaw update --channel beta
openclaw update --channel dev

```

- `stable`/`beta` check out the latest matching tag (often the same tag).

- `dev` switches to `main` and rebases on the upstream.

npm/pnpm global install:
Copy

```
openclaw update --channel stable
openclaw update --channel beta
openclaw update --channel dev

```

This updates via the corresponding npm dist-tag (`latest`, `beta`, `dev`).
When you **explicitly** switch channels with `--channel`, OpenClaw also aligns
the install method:

- `dev` ensures a git checkout (default `~/openclaw`, override with `OPENCLAW_GIT_DIR`),
updates it, and installs the global CLI from that checkout.

- `stable`/`beta` installs from npm using the matching dist-tag.

Tip: if you want stable + dev in parallel, keep two clones and point your gateway at the stable one.

Plugins and channels

When you switch channels with `openclaw update`, OpenClaw also syncs plugin sources:

- `dev` prefers bundled plugins from the git checkout.

- `stable` and `beta` restore npm-installed plugin packages.

Tagging best practices

- Tag releases you want git checkouts to land on (`vYYYY.M.D` for stable, `vYYYY.M.D-beta.N` for beta).

- `vYYYY.M.D.beta.N` is also recognized for compatibility, but prefer `-beta.N`.

- Legacy `vYYYY.M.D-<patch>` tags are still recognized as stable (non-beta).

- Keep tags immutable: never move or reuse a tag.

- npm dist-tags remain the source of truth for npm installs:

`latest` → stable

- `beta` → candidate build

- `dev` → main snapshot (optional)

## [​
](#macos-app-availability)
macOS app availability

Beta and dev builds may **not** include a macOS app release. That’s OK:

- The git tag and npm dist-tag can still be published.

- Call out “no macOS build for this beta” in release notes or changelog.
