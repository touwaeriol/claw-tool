Onboarding (macOS App)

This doc describes the **current** first‑run onboarding flow. The goal is a
smooth “day 0” experience: pick where the Gateway runs, connect auth, run the
wizard, and let the agent bootstrap itself.
For a general overview of onboarding paths, see [Onboarding Overview](/start/onboarding-overview).

Welcome and security notice

Security trust model:
- By default, OpenClaw is a personal agent: one trusted operator boundary.

- Shared/multi-user setups require lock-down (split trust boundaries, keep tool access minimal, and follow [Security](/gateway/security)).

- Local onboarding now defaults new configs to `tools.profile: "coding"` so fresh local setups keep filesystem/runtime tools without forcing the unrestricted `full` profile.

- If hooks/webhooks or other untrusted content feeds are enabled, use a strong modern model tier and keep strict tool policy/sandboxing.

Local vs Remote

Where does the **Gateway** run?
- **This Mac (Local only):** onboarding can configure auth and write credentials
locally.

- **Remote (over SSH/Tailnet):** onboarding does **not** configure local auth;
credentials must exist on the gateway host.

- **Configure later:** skip setup and leave the app unconfigured.

**Gateway auth tip:**
- The wizard now generates a **token** even for loopback, so local WS clients must authenticate.

- If you disable auth, any local process can connect; use that only on fully trusted machines.

- Use a **token** for multi‑machine access or non‑loopback binds.

- Microphone

- Speech Recognition

- Camera

- Location

CLI

This step is optional

The app can install the global `openclaw` CLI via npm/pnpm so terminal
workflows and launchd tasks work out of the box.

Onboarding Chat (dedicated session)

After setup, the app opens a dedicated onboarding chat session so the agent can
introduce itself and guide next steps. This keeps first‑run guidance separate
from your normal conversation. See [Bootstrapping](/start/bootstrapping) for
what happens on the gateway host during the first agent run.
