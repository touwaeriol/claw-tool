# Gateway on macOS

# [​
](#gateway-on-macos-external-launchd)
Gateway on macOS (external launchd)

OpenClaw.app no longer bundles Node/Bun or the Gateway runtime. The macOS app
expects an **external** `openclaw` CLI install, does not spawn the Gateway as a
child process, and manages a per‑user launchd service to keep the Gateway
running (or attaches to an existing local Gateway if one is already running).

## [​
](#install-the-cli-required-for-local-mode)
Install the CLI (required for local mode)

You need Node 22+ on the Mac, then install `openclaw` globally:
Copy

```
npm install -g openclaw@<version>

```

The macOS app’s **Install CLI** button runs the same flow via npm/pnpm (bun not recommended for Gateway runtime).

## [​
](#launchd-gateway-as-launchagent)
Launchd (Gateway as LaunchAgent)

Label:

- `ai.openclaw.gateway` (or `ai.openclaw.<profile>`; legacy `com.openclaw.*` may remain)

Plist location (per‑user):

- `~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.openclaw.gateway.plist`
(or `~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.openclaw.<profile>.plist`)

Manager:

- The macOS app owns LaunchAgent install/update in Local mode.

- The CLI can also install it: `openclaw gateway install`.

Behavior:

- “OpenClaw Active” enables/disables the LaunchAgent.

- App quit does **not** stop the gateway (launchd keeps it alive).

- If a Gateway is already running on the configured port, the app attaches to
it instead of starting a new one.

Logging:

- launchd stdout/err: `/tmp/openclaw/openclaw-gateway.log`

## [​
](#version-compatibility)
Version compatibility

The macOS app checks the gateway version against its own version. If they’re
incompatible, update the global CLI to match the app version.

## [​
](#smoke-check)
Smoke check

Copy

```
openclaw --version

OPENCLAW_SKIP_CHANNELS=1 \
OPENCLAW_SKIP_CANVAS_HOST=1 \
openclaw gateway --port 18999 --bind loopback

```

Then:
Copy

```
openclaw gateway call health --url ws://127.0.0.1:18999 --timeout 3000

```
