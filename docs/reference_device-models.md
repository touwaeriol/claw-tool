# Device Model Database

# [​

Device model database (friendly names)

The macOS companion app shows friendly Apple device model names in the **Instances** UI by mapping Apple model identifiers (e.g. `iPad16,6`, `Mac16,6`) to human-readable names.
The mapping is vendored as JSON under:

- `apps/macos/Sources/OpenClaw/Resources/DeviceModels/`

## [​
](#data-source)
Data source

We currently vendor the mapping from the MIT-licensed repository:

- `kyle-seongwoo-jun/apple-device-identifiers`

To keep builds deterministic, the JSON files are pinned to specific upstream commits (recorded in `apps/macos/Sources/OpenClaw/Resources/DeviceModels/NOTICE.md`).

## [​
](#updating-the-database)
Updating the database

- Pick the upstream commits you want to pin to (one for iOS, one for macOS).

- Update the commit hashes in `apps/macos/Sources/OpenClaw/Resources/DeviceModels/NOTICE.md`.

- Re-download the JSON files, pinned to those commits:

Copy

```
IOS_COMMIT="<commit sha for ios-device-identifiers.json>"
MAC_COMMIT="<commit sha for mac-device-identifiers.json>"

curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kyle-seongwoo-jun/apple-device-identifiers/${IOS_COMMIT}/ios-device-identifiers.json" \
  -o apps/macos/Sources/OpenClaw/Resources/DeviceModels/ios-device-identifiers.json

curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kyle-seongwoo-jun/apple-device-identifiers/${MAC_COMMIT}/mac-device-identifiers.json" \
  -o apps/macos/Sources/OpenClaw/Resources/DeviceModels/mac-device-identifiers.json

```

- Ensure `apps/macos/Sources/OpenClaw/Resources/DeviceModels/LICENSE.apple-device-identifiers.txt` still matches upstream (replace it if the upstream license changes).

- Verify the macOS app builds cleanly (no warnings):

Copy

```
swift build --package-path apps/macos

```
