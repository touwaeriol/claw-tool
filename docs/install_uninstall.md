# Uninstall

# [​

Uninstall

Two paths:

- **Easy path** if `openclaw` is still installed.

- **Manual service removal** if the CLI is gone but the service is still running.

## [​
](#easy-path-cli-still-installed)
Easy path (CLI still installed)

Recommended: use the built-in uninstaller:
Copy

```
openclaw uninstall

```

Non-interactive (automation / npx):
Copy

```
openclaw uninstall --all --yes --non-interactive
npx -y openclaw uninstall --all --yes --non-interactive

```

Manual steps (same result):

- Stop the gateway service:

Copy

```
openclaw gateway stop

```

- Uninstall the gateway service (launchd/systemd/schtasks):

Copy

```
openclaw gateway uninstall

```

- Delete state + config:

Copy

```
rm -rf "${OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR:-$HOME/.openclaw}"

```

If you set `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH` to a custom location outside the state dir, delete that file too.

- Delete your workspace (optional, removes agent files):

Copy

```
rm -rf ~/.openclaw/workspace

```

- Remove the CLI install (pick the one you used):

Copy

```
npm rm -g openclaw
pnpm remove -g openclaw
bun remove -g openclaw

```

- If you installed the macOS app:

Copy

```
rm -rf /Applications/OpenClaw.app

```

Notes:

- If you used profiles (`--profile` / `OPENCLAW_PROFILE`), repeat step 3 for each state dir (defaults are `~/.openclaw-<profile>`).

- In remote mode, the state dir lives on the **gateway host**, so run steps 1-4 there too.

## [​
](#manual-service-removal-cli-not-installed)
Manual service removal (CLI not installed)

Use this if the gateway service keeps running but `openclaw` is missing.

### [​
](#macos-launchd)
macOS (launchd)

Default label is `ai.openclaw.gateway` (or `ai.openclaw.<profile>`; legacy `com.openclaw.*` may still exist):
Copy

```
launchctl bootout gui/$UID/ai.openclaw.gateway
rm -f ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.openclaw.gateway.plist

```

If you used a profile, replace the label and plist name with `ai.openclaw.<profile>`. Remove any legacy `com.openclaw.*` plists if present.

### [​
](#linux-systemd-user-unit)
Linux (systemd user unit)

Default unit name is `openclaw-gateway.service` (or `openclaw-gateway-<profile>.service`):
Copy

```
systemctl --user disable --now openclaw-gateway.service
rm -f ~/.config/systemd/user/openclaw-gateway.service
systemctl --user daemon-reload

```

### [​
](#windows-scheduled-task)
Windows (Scheduled Task)

Default task name is `OpenClaw Gateway` (or `OpenClaw Gateway (<profile>)`).
The task script lives under your state dir.
Copy

```
schtasks /Delete /F /TN "OpenClaw Gateway"
Remove-Item -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\.openclaw\gateway.cmd"

```

If you used a profile, delete the matching task name and `~\.openclaw-<profile>\gateway.cmd`.

## [​
](#normal-install-vs-source-checkout)
Normal install vs source checkout

### [​
](#normal-install-install-sh-/-npm-/-pnpm-/-bun)
Normal install (install.sh / npm / pnpm / bun)

If you used `https://openclaw.ai/install.sh` or `install.ps1`, the CLI was installed with `npm install -g openclaw@latest`.
Remove it with `npm rm -g openclaw` (or `pnpm remove -g` / `bun remove -g` if you installed that way).

### [​
](#source-checkout-git-clone)
Source checkout (git clone)

If you run from a repo checkout (`git clone` + `openclaw ...` / `bun run openclaw ...`):

- Uninstall the gateway service **before** deleting the repo (use the easy path above or manual service removal).

- Delete the repo directory.

- Remove state + workspace as shown above.
