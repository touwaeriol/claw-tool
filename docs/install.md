Install

Already followed [Getting Started](/start/getting-started)? You’re all set — this page is for alternative install methods, platform-specific instructions, and maintenance.

## [​
](#system-requirements)
System requirements

- **[Node 22+](/install/node)** (the [installer script](#install-methods) will install it if missing)

- macOS, Linux, or Windows

- `pnpm` only if you build from source

On Windows, we strongly recommend running OpenClaw under [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

Install methods

The **installer script** is the recommended way to install OpenClaw. It handles Node detection, installation, and onboarding in one step.

For VPS/cloud hosts, avoid third-party “1-click” marketplace images when possible. Prefer a clean base OS image (for example Ubuntu LTS), then install OpenClaw yourself with the installer script.

Installer script

Downloads the CLI, installs it globally via npm, and launches the onboarding wizard.-  macOS / Linux / WSL2

-  Windows (PowerShell)

Copy

```
curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash

```

Copy

```
iwr -useb https://openclaw.ai/install.ps1 | iex

```

That’s it — the script handles Node detection, installation, and onboarding.To skip onboarding and just install the binary:-  macOS / Linux / WSL2

-  Windows (PowerShell)

Copy

```
curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash -s -- --no-onboard

```

Copy

```
& ([scriptblock]::Create((iwr -useb https://openclaw.ai/install.ps1))) -NoOnboard

```

For all flags, env vars, and CI/automation options, see [Installer internals](/install/installer).

npm / pnpm

If you already have Node 22+ and prefer to manage the install yourself:-  npm

-  pnpm

Copy

```
npm install -g openclaw@latest
openclaw onboard --install-daemon

```

sharp build errors?

If you have libvips installed globally (common on macOS via Homebrew) and `sharp` fails, force prebuilt binaries:Copy

```
SHARP_IGNORE_GLOBAL_LIBVIPS=1 npm install -g openclaw@latest

```

If you see `sharp: Please add node-gyp to your dependencies`, either install build tooling (macOS: Xcode CLT + `npm install -g node-gyp`) or use the env var above.

Copy

```
pnpm add -g openclaw@latest
pnpm approve-builds -g        # approve openclaw, node-llama-cpp, sharp, etc.
openclaw onboard --install-daemon

```

pnpm requires explicit approval for packages with build scripts. After the first install shows the “Ignored build scripts” warning, run `pnpm approve-builds -g` and select the listed packages.

From source

For contributors or anyone who wants to run from a local checkout.

cd openclaw
pnpm install
pnpm ui:build
pnpm build

```

Link the CLI

Make the `openclaw` command available globally:Copy

```
pnpm link --global

```

Alternatively, skip the link and run commands via `pnpm openclaw ...` from inside the repo.

Run onboarding

Copy

```
openclaw onboard --install-daemon

```

For deeper development workflows, see [Setup](/start/setup).

## [​
](#other-install-methods)
Other install methods

## Docker

Containerized or headless deployments.

## Podman

Rootless container: run `setup-podman.sh` once, then the launch script.

## Nix

Declarative install via Nix.

## Ansible

Automated fleet provisioning.

## Bun

CLI-only usage via the Bun runtime.

## [​
](#after-install)
After install

Verify everything is working:
Copy

```
openclaw doctor         # check for config issues
openclaw status         # gateway status
openclaw dashboard      # open the browser UI

```

If you need custom runtime paths, use:

- `OPENCLAW_HOME` for home-directory based internal paths

- `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` for mutable state location

- `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH` for config file location

See [Environment vars](/help/environment) for precedence and full details.

Troubleshooting: `openclaw` not found

PATH diagnosis and fix

Quick diagnosis:Copy

```
node -v
npm -v
npm prefix -g
echo "$PATH"

```

If `$(npm prefix -g)/bin` (macOS/Linux) or `$(npm prefix -g)` (Windows) is **not** in your `$PATH`, your shell can’t find global npm binaries (including `openclaw`).Fix — add it to your shell startup file (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`):Copy

```
export PATH="$(npm prefix -g)/bin:$PATH"

```

On Windows, add the output of `npm prefix -g` to your PATH.Then open a new terminal (or `rehash` in zsh / `hash -r` in bash).
