Getting Started

Goal: go from zero to a first working chat with minimal setup.

Fastest chat: open the Control UI (no channel setup needed). Run `openclaw dashboard`
and chat in the browser, or open `http://127.0.0.1:18789/` on the
gateway host.
Docs: [Dashboard](/web/dashboard) and [Control UI](/web/control-ui).
