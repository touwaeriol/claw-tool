# Gateway Protocol

# [​

Gateway protocol (WebSocket)

The Gateway WS protocol is the **single control plane + node transport** for
OpenClaw. All clients (CLI, web UI, macOS app, iOS/Android nodes, headless
nodes) connect over WebSocket and declare their **role** + **scope** at
handshake time.

## [​
](#transport)
Transport

- WebSocket, text frames with JSON payloads.

- First frame **must** be a `connect` request.

## [​

Handshake (connect)

Gateway → Client (pre-connect challenge):
Copy

```
{
  "type": "event",
  "event": "connect.challenge",
  "payload": { "nonce": "…", "ts": 1737264000000 }
}

```

Client → Gateway:
Copy

```
{
  "type": "req",
  "id": "…",
  "method": "connect",
  "params": {
    "minProtocol": 3,
    "maxProtocol": 3,
    "client": {
      "id": "cli",
      "version": "1.2.3",
      "platform": "macos",
      "mode": "operator"
    },
    "role": "operator",
    "scopes": ["operator.read", "operator.write"],
    "caps": [],
    "commands": [],
    "permissions": {},
    "auth": { "token": "…" },
    "locale": "en-US",
    "userAgent": "openclaw-cli/1.2.3",
    "device": {
      "id": "device_fingerprint",
      "publicKey": "…",
      "signature": "…",
      "signedAt": 1737264000000,
      "nonce": "…"
    }
  }
}

```

Gateway → Client:
Copy

```
{
  "type": "res",
  "id": "…",
  "ok": true,
  "payload": { "type": "hello-ok", "protocol": 3, "policy": { "tickIntervalMs": 15000 } }
}

```

When a device token is issued, `hello-ok` also includes:
Copy

```
{
  "auth": {
    "deviceToken": "…",
    "role": "operator",
    "scopes": ["operator.read", "operator.write"]
  }
}

```

## [​
](#framing)
Framing

- **Request**: `{type:"req", id, method, params}`

- **Response**: `{type:"res", id, ok, payload|error}`

- **Event**: `{type:"event", event, payload, seq?, stateVersion?}`

Side-effecting methods require **idempotency keys** (see schema).

## [​
](#roles-+-scopes)
Roles + scopes

### [​
](#roles)
Roles

- `operator` = control plane client (CLI/UI/automation).

- `node` = capability host (camera/screen/canvas/system.run).

### [​
](#scopes-operator)
Scopes (operator)

Common scopes:

- `operator.read`

- `operator.write`

- `operator.admin`

- `operator.approvals`

- `operator.pairing`

Method scope is only the first gate. Some slash commands reached through
`chat.send` apply stricter command-level checks on top. For example, persistent
`/config set` and `/config unset` writes require `operator.admin`.

### [​
](#caps/commands/permissions-node)
Caps/commands/permissions (node)

Nodes declare capability claims at connect time:

- `caps`: high-level capability categories.

- `commands`: command allowlist for invoke.

- `permissions`: granular toggles (e.g. `screen.record`, `camera.capture`).

The Gateway treats these as **claims** and enforces server-side allowlists.

## [​
](#presence)
Presence

- `system-presence` returns entries keyed by device identity.

- Presence entries include `deviceId`, `roles`, and `scopes` so UIs can show a single row per device
even when it connects as both **operator** and **node**.

### [​
](#node-helper-methods)
Node helper methods

- Nodes may call `skills.bins` to fetch the current list of skill executables
for auto-allow checks.

### [​
](#operator-helper-methods)
Operator helper methods

- Operators may call `tools.catalog` (`operator.read`) to fetch the runtime tool catalog for an
agent. The response includes grouped tools and provenance metadata:

`source`: `core` or `plugin`

- `pluginId`: plugin owner when `source="plugin"`

- `optional`: whether a plugin tool is optional

## [​
](#exec-approvals)
Exec approvals

- When an exec request needs approval, the gateway broadcasts `exec.approval.requested`.

- Operator clients resolve by calling `exec.approval.resolve` (requires `operator.approvals` scope).

- For `host=node`, `exec.approval.request` must include `systemRunPlan` (canonical `argv`/`cwd`/`rawCommand`/session metadata). Requests missing `systemRunPlan` are rejected.

## [​
](#versioning)
Versioning

- `PROTOCOL_VERSION` lives in `src/gateway/protocol/schema.ts`.

- Clients send `minProtocol` + `maxProtocol`; the server rejects mismatches.

- Schemas + models are generated from TypeBox definitions:

`pnpm protocol:gen`

- `pnpm protocol:gen:swift`

- `pnpm protocol:check`

## [​
](#auth)
Auth

- If `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` (or `--token`) is set, `connect.params.auth.token`
must match or the socket is closed.

- After pairing, the Gateway issues a **device token** scoped to the connection
role + scopes. It is returned in `hello-ok.auth.deviceToken` and should be
persisted by the client for future connects.

- Device tokens can be rotated/revoked via `device.token.rotate` and
`device.token.revoke` (requires `operator.pairing` scope).

## [​
](#device-identity-+-pairing)
Device identity + pairing

- Nodes should include a stable device identity (`device.id`) derived from a
keypair fingerprint.

- Gateways issue tokens per device + role.

- Pairing approvals are required for new device IDs unless local auto-approval
is enabled.

- **Local** connects include loopback and the gateway host’s own tailnet address
(so same‑host tailnet binds can still auto‑approve).

- All WS clients must include `device` identity during `connect` (operator + node).
Control UI can omit it **only** when `gateway.controlUi.dangerouslyDisableDeviceAuth`
is enabled for break-glass use.

- All connections must sign the server-provided `connect.challenge` nonce.

### [​
](#device-auth-migration-diagnostics)
Device auth migration diagnostics

For legacy clients that still use pre-challenge signing behavior, `connect` now returns
`DEVICE_AUTH_*` detail codes under `error.details.code` with a stable `error.details.reason`.
Common migration failures:
Messagedetails.codedetails.reasonMeaning`device nonce required``DEVICE_AUTH_NONCE_REQUIRED``device-nonce-missing`Client omitted `device.nonce` (or sent blank).`device nonce mismatch``DEVICE_AUTH_NONCE_MISMATCH``device-nonce-mismatch`Client signed with a stale/wrong nonce.`device signature invalid``DEVICE_AUTH_SIGNATURE_INVALID``device-signature`Signature payload does not match v2 payload.`device signature expired``DEVICE_AUTH_SIGNATURE_EXPIRED``device-signature-stale`Signed timestamp is outside allowed skew.`device identity mismatch``DEVICE_AUTH_DEVICE_ID_MISMATCH``device-id-mismatch``device.id` does not match public key fingerprint.`device public key invalid``DEVICE_AUTH_PUBLIC_KEY_INVALID``device-public-key`Public key format/canonicalization failed.

Migration target:

- Always wait for `connect.challenge`.

- Sign the v2 payload that includes the server nonce.

- Send the same nonce in `connect.params.device.nonce`.

- Preferred signature payload is `v3`, which binds `platform` and `deviceFamily`
in addition to device/client/role/scopes/token/nonce fields.

- Legacy `v2` signatures remain accepted for compatibility, but paired-device
metadata pinning still controls command policy on reconnect.

## [​
](#tls-+-pinning)
TLS + pinning

- TLS is supported for WS connections.

- Clients may optionally pin the gateway cert fingerprint (see `gateway.tls`
config plus `gateway.remote.tlsFingerprint` or CLI `--tls-fingerprint`).

## [​
](#scope)
Scope

This protocol exposes the **full gateway API** (status, channels, models, chat,
agent, sessions, nodes, approvals, etc.). The exact surface is defined by the
TypeBox schemas in `src/gateway/protocol/schema.ts`.
