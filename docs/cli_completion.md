CLI commands

](#openclaw-completion)
`openclaw completion`

Generate shell completion scripts and optionally install them into your shell profile.

## [​
](#usage)
Usage

Copy

```
openclaw completion
openclaw completion --shell zsh
openclaw completion --install
openclaw completion --shell fish --install
openclaw completion --write-state
openclaw completion --shell bash --write-state

```

## [​
](#options)
Options

- `-s, --shell <shell>`: shell target (`zsh`, `bash`, `powershell`, `fish`; default: `zsh`)

- `-i, --install`: install completion by adding a source line to your shell profile

- `--write-state`: write completion script(s) to `$OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR/completions` without printing to stdout

- `-y, --yes`: skip install confirmation prompts

## [​
](#notes)
Notes

- `--install` writes a small “OpenClaw Completion” block into your shell profile and points it at the cached script.

- Without `--install` or `--write-state`, the command prints the script to stdout.

- Completion generation eagerly loads command trees so nested subcommands are included.
