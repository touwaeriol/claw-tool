# [​
](#openclaw-agents)
`openclaw agents`

Manage isolated agents (workspaces + auth + routing).

## [​
](#examples)
Examples

Copy

```
openclaw agents list
openclaw agents add work --workspace ~/.openclaw/workspace-work
openclaw agents bindings
openclaw agents bind --agent work --bind telegram:ops
openclaw agents unbind --agent work --bind telegram:ops
openclaw agents set-identity --workspace ~/.openclaw/workspace --from-identity
openclaw agents set-identity --agent main --avatar avatars/openclaw.png
openclaw agents delete work

```

## [​
](#routing-bindings)
Routing bindings

Use routing bindings to pin inbound channel traffic to a specific agent.
List bindings:
Copy

```
openclaw agents bindings
openclaw agents bindings --agent work
openclaw agents bindings --json

```

Add bindings:
Copy

```
openclaw agents bind --agent work --bind telegram:ops --bind discord:guild-a

```

If you omit `accountId` (`--bind <channel>`), OpenClaw resolves it from channel defaults and plugin setup hooks when available.

### [​
](#binding-scope-behavior)
Binding scope behavior

- A binding without `accountId` matches the channel default account only.

- `accountId: "*"` is the channel-wide fallback (all accounts) and is less specific than an explicit account binding.

- If the same agent already has a matching channel binding without `accountId`, and you later bind with an explicit or resolved `accountId`, OpenClaw upgrades that existing binding in place instead of adding a duplicate.

Example:
Copy

```
# initial channel-only binding
openclaw agents bind --agent work --bind telegram

# later upgrade to account-scoped binding
openclaw agents bind --agent work --bind telegram:ops

```

After the upgrade, routing for that binding is scoped to `telegram:ops`. If you also want default-account routing, add it explicitly (for example `--bind telegram:default`).
Remove bindings:
Copy

```
openclaw agents unbind --agent work --bind telegram:ops
openclaw agents unbind --agent work --all

```

## [​
](#identity-files)
Identity files

Each agent workspace can include an `IDENTITY.md` at the workspace root:

- Example path: `~/.openclaw/workspace/IDENTITY.md`

- `set-identity --from-identity` reads from the workspace root (or an explicit `--identity-file`)

Avatar paths resolve relative to the workspace root.

## [​
](#set-identity)
Set identity

`set-identity` writes fields into `agents.list[].identity`:

- `name`

- `theme`

- `emoji`

- `avatar` (workspace-relative path, http(s) URL, or data URI)

Load from `IDENTITY.md`:
Copy

```
openclaw agents set-identity --workspace ~/.openclaw/workspace --from-identity

```

Override fields explicitly:
Copy

```
openclaw agents set-identity --agent main --name "OpenClaw" --emoji "🦞" --avatar avatars/openclaw.png

```

Config sample:
Copy

```
{
  agents: {
    list: [
      {
        id: "main",
        identity: {
          name: "OpenClaw",
          theme: "space lobster",
          emoji: "🦞",
          avatar: "avatars/openclaw.png",
        },
      },
    ],
  },
}

```
