# Markdown Formatting

Markdown formatting

OpenClaw formats outbound Markdown by converting it into a shared intermediate
representation (IR) before rendering channel-specific output. The IR keeps the
source text intact while carrying style/link spans so chunking and rendering can
stay consistent across channels.

## [​

Goals

- **Consistency:** one parse step, multiple renderers.

- **Safe chunking:** split text before rendering so inline formatting never
breaks across chunks.

- **Channel fit:** map the same IR to Slack mrkdwn, Telegram HTML, and Signal
style ranges without re-parsing Markdown.

## [​
](#pipeline)
Pipeline

- **Parse Markdown -> IR**

IR is plain text plus style spans (bold/italic/strike/code/spoiler) and link spans.

- Offsets are UTF-16 code units so Signal style ranges align with its API.

- Tables are parsed only when a channel opts into table conversion.

- **Chunk IR (format-first)**

Chunking happens on the IR text before rendering.

- Inline formatting does not split across chunks; spans are sliced per chunk.

- **Render per channel**

**Slack:** mrkdwn tokens (bold/italic/strike/code), links as `<url|label>`.

- **Telegram:** HTML tags (`<b>`, `<i>`, `<s>`, `<code>`, `<pre><code>`, `<a href>`).

- **Signal:** plain text + `text-style` ranges; links become `label (url)` when label differs.

## [​
](#ir-example)
IR example

Input Markdown:
Copy

```
Hello **world** — see [docs](https://docs.openclaw.ai).

```

IR (schematic):
Copy

```
{
  "text": "Hello world — see docs.",
  "styles": [{ "start": 6, "end": 11, "style": "bold" }],
  "links": [{ "start": 19, "end": 23, "href": "https://docs.openclaw.ai" }]
}

```

## [​
](#where-it-is-used)
Where it is used

- Slack, Telegram, and Signal outbound adapters render from the IR.

- Other channels (WhatsApp, iMessage, MS Teams, Discord) still use plain text or
their own formatting rules, with Markdown table conversion applied before
chunking when enabled.

## [​
](#table-handling)
Table handling

Markdown tables are not consistently supported across chat clients. Use
`markdown.tables` to control conversion per channel (and per account).

- `code`: render tables as code blocks (default for most channels).

- `bullets`: convert each row into bullet points (default for Signal + WhatsApp).

- `off`: disable table parsing and conversion; raw table text passes through.

Config keys:
Copy

```
channels:
  discord:
    markdown:
      tables: code
    accounts:
      work:
        markdown:
          tables: off

```

## [​
](#chunking-rules)
Chunking rules

- Chunk limits come from channel adapters/config and are applied to the IR text.

- Code fences are preserved as a single block with a trailing newline so channels
render them correctly.

- List prefixes and blockquote prefixes are part of the IR text, so chunking
does not split mid-prefix.

- Inline styles (bold/italic/strike/inline-code/spoiler) are never split across
chunks; the renderer reopens styles inside each chunk.

If you need more on chunking behavior across channels, see
[Streaming + chunking](/concepts/streaming).

## [​
](#link-policy)
Link policy

- **Slack:** `[label](url)` -> `<url|label>`; bare URLs remain bare. Autolink
is disabled during parse to avoid double-linking.

- **Telegram:** `[label](url)` -> `<a href="url">label</a>` (HTML parse mode).

- **Signal:** `[label](url)` -> `label (url)` unless label matches the URL.

## [​
](#spoilers)
Spoilers

Spoiler markers (`||spoiler||`) are parsed only for Signal, where they map to
SPOILER style ranges. Other channels treat them as plain text.

## [​
](#how-to-add-or-update-a-channel-formatter)
How to add or update a channel formatter

- **Parse once:** use the shared `markdownToIR(...)` helper with channel-appropriate
options (autolink, heading style, blockquote prefix).

- **Render:** implement a renderer with `renderMarkdownWithMarkers(...)` and a
style marker map (or Signal style ranges).

- **Chunk:** call `chunkMarkdownIR(...)` before rendering; render each chunk.

- **Wire adapter:** update the channel outbound adapter to use the new chunker
and renderer.

- **Test:** add or update format tests and an outbound delivery test if the
channel uses chunking.

## [​
](#common-gotchas)
Common gotchas

- Slack angle-bracket tokens (`<@U123>`, `<#C123>`, `<https://...>`) must be
preserved; escape raw HTML safely.

- Telegram HTML requires escaping text outside tags to avoid broken markup.

- Signal style ranges depend on UTF-16 offsets; do not use code point offsets.

- Preserve trailing newlines for fenced code blocks so closing markers land on
their own line.
