Usage

Copy

```
openclaw qr
openclaw qr --setup-code-only
openclaw qr --json
openclaw qr --remote
openclaw qr --url wss://gateway.example/ws --token &#x27;<token>&#x27;

```

## [​
](#options)
Options

- `--remote`: use `gateway.remote.url` plus remote token/password from config

- `--url <url>`: override gateway URL used in payload

- `--public-url <url>`: override public URL used in payload

- `--token <token>`: override gateway token for payload

- `--password <password>`: override gateway password for payload

- `--setup-code-only`: print only setup code

- `--no-ascii`: skip ASCII QR rendering

- `--json`: emit JSON (`setupCode`, `gatewayUrl`, `auth`, `urlSource`)

## [​
](#notes)
Notes

- `--token` and `--password` are mutually exclusive.

- With `--remote`, if effectively active remote credentials are configured as SecretRefs and you do not pass `--token` or `--password`, the command resolves them from the active gateway snapshot. If gateway is unavailable, the command fails fast.

- Without `--remote`, local gateway auth SecretRefs are resolved when no CLI auth override is passed:

`gateway.auth.token` resolves when token auth can win (explicit `gateway.auth.mode="token"` or inferred mode where no password source wins).

- `gateway.auth.password` resolves when password auth can win (explicit `gateway.auth.mode="password"` or inferred mode with no winning token from auth/env).

- If both `gateway.auth.token` and `gateway.auth.password` are configured (including SecretRefs) and `gateway.auth.mode` is unset, setup-code resolution fails until mode is set explicitly.

- Gateway version skew note: this command path requires a gateway that supports `secrets.resolve`; older gateways return an unknown-method error.

- After scanning, approve device pairing with:

`openclaw devices list`

- `openclaw devices approve <requestId>`
