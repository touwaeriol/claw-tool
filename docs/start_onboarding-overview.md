Onboarding Overview

OpenClaw supports multiple onboarding paths depending on where the Gateway runs
and how you prefer to configure providers.

## [​
](#choose-your-onboarding-path)
Choose your onboarding path

- **CLI wizard** for macOS, Linux, and Windows (via WSL2).

- **macOS app** for a guided first run on Apple silicon or Intel Macs.

## [​
](#cli-onboarding-wizard)
CLI onboarding wizard

Run the wizard in a terminal:
Copy

```
openclaw onboard

```

Use the CLI wizard when you want full control of the Gateway, workspace,
channels, and skills. Docs:

- [Onboarding Wizard (CLI)](/start/wizard)

- [`openclaw onboard` command](/cli/onboard)

## [​
](#macos-app-onboarding)
macOS app onboarding

Use the OpenClaw app when you want a fully guided setup on macOS. Docs:

- [Onboarding (macOS App)](/start/onboarding)

## [​
](#custom-provider)
Custom Provider

If you need an endpoint that is not listed, including hosted providers that
expose standard OpenAI or Anthropic APIs, choose **Custom Provider** in the
CLI wizard. You will be asked to:

- Pick OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic-compatible, or **Unknown** (auto-detect).

- Enter a base URL and API key (if required by the provider).

- Provide a model ID and optional alias.

- Choose an Endpoint ID so multiple custom endpoints can coexist.

For detailed steps, follow the CLI onboarding docs above.
