Overview

- A single long‑lived **Gateway** owns all messaging surfaces (WhatsApp via
Baileys, Telegram via grammY, Slack, Discord, Signal, iMessage, WebChat).

- Control-plane clients (macOS app, CLI, web UI, automations) connect to the
Gateway over **WebSocket** on the configured bind host (default
`127.0.0.1:18789`).

- **Nodes** (macOS/iOS/Android/headless) also connect over **WebSocket**, but
declare `role: node` with explicit caps/commands.

- One Gateway per host; it is the only place that opens a WhatsApp session.

- The **canvas host** is served by the Gateway HTTP server under:

`/__openclaw__/canvas/` (agent-editable HTML/CSS/JS)

- `/__openclaw__/a2ui/` (A2UI host)
It uses the same port as the Gateway (default `18789`).

Components and flows

### [​
](#gateway-daemon)
Gateway (daemon)

- Maintains provider connections.

- Exposes a typed WS API (requests, responses, server‑push events).

- Validates inbound frames against JSON Schema.

- Emits events like `agent`, `chat`, `presence`, `health`, `heartbeat`, `cron`.

### [​
](#clients-mac-app-/-cli-/-web-admin)
Clients (mac app / CLI / web admin)

- One WS connection per client.

- Send requests (`health`, `status`, `send`, `agent`, `system-presence`).

- Subscribe to events (`tick`, `agent`, `presence`, `shutdown`).

### [​
](#nodes-macos-/-ios-/-android-/-headless)
Nodes (macOS / iOS / Android / headless)

- Connect to the **same WS server** with `role: node`.

- Provide a device identity in `connect`; pairing is **device‑based** (role `node`) and
approval lives in the device pairing store.

- Expose commands like `canvas.*`, `camera.*`, `screen.record`, `location.get`.

Protocol details:

- [Gateway protocol](/gateway/protocol)

### [​
](#webchat)
WebChat

- Static UI that uses the Gateway WS API for chat history and sends.

- In remote setups, connects through the same SSH/Tailscale tunnel as other
clients.

## [​
](#wire-protocol-summary)
Wire protocol (summary)

- Transport: WebSocket, text frames with JSON payloads.

- First frame **must** be `connect`.

- After handshake:

Requests: `{type:"req", id, method, params}` → `{type:"res", id, ok, payload|error}`

- Events: `{type:"event", event, payload, seq?, stateVersion?}`

- If `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` (or `--token`) is set, `connect.params.auth.token`
must match or the socket closes.

- Idempotency keys are required for side‑effecting methods (`send`, `agent`) to
safely retry; the server keeps a short‑lived dedupe cache.

- Nodes must include `role: "node"` plus caps/commands/permissions in `connect`.

## [​
](#pairing-+-local-trust)
Pairing + local trust

- All WS clients (operators + nodes) include a **device identity** on `connect`.

- New device IDs require pairing approval; the Gateway issues a **device token**
for subsequent connects.

- **Local** connects (loopback or the gateway host’s own tailnet address) can be
auto‑approved to keep same‑host UX smooth.

- All connects must sign the `connect.challenge` nonce.

- Signature payload `v3` also binds `platform` + `deviceFamily`; the gateway
pins paired metadata on reconnect and requires repair pairing for metadata
changes.

- **Non‑local** connects still require explicit approval.

- Gateway auth (`gateway.auth.*`) still applies to **all** connections, local or
remote.

Details: [Gateway protocol](/gateway/protocol), [Pairing](/channels/pairing),
[Security](/gateway/security).

## [​
](#protocol-typing-and-codegen)
Protocol typing and codegen

- TypeBox schemas define the protocol.

- JSON Schema is generated from those schemas.

- Swift models are generated from the JSON Schema.

## [​
](#remote-access)
Remote access

- 
Preferred: Tailscale or VPN.

- 
Alternative: SSH tunnel
Copy

```
ssh -N -L 18789:127.0.0.1:18789 user@host

```

- 
The same handshake + auth token apply over the tunnel.

- 
TLS + optional pinning can be enabled for WS in remote setups.

## [​
](#operations-snapshot)
Operations snapshot

- Start: `openclaw gateway` (foreground, logs to stdout).

- Health: `health` over WS (also included in `hello-ok`).

- Supervision: launchd/systemd for auto‑restart.

## [​
](#invariants)
Invariants

- Exactly one Gateway controls a single Baileys session per host.

- Handshake is mandatory; any non‑JSON or non‑connect first frame is a hard close.

- Events are not replayed; clients must refresh on gaps.
